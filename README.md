## What
Japan's [Reconstruction Agency](http://www.reconstruction.go.jp/) compiles [data on Great East Japan Earthquake evacuees](http://www.reconstruction.go.jp/topics/main-cat2/sub-cat2-1/hinanshasuu.html). The data shared on the agency's website is in PDF files. For this repository, the data was extracted from the PDF files with [Tabula Extractor](https://github.com/jazzido/tabula-extractor).
